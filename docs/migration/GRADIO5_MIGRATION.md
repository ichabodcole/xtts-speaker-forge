   - Solution: Verify tab properties and behavior with test scripts
   - Status: ✅ Working correctly

3. **Event Handling**

   - Status: ✅ No major styling issues encountered

## Migration Complete

All aspects of the application have been successfully migrated to Gradio 5.22.0. The application is now running correctly with all views functioning as expected. Test files have been removed, and the codebase is clean and ready for use.
